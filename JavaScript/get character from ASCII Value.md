# Get Character From ASCII Value Code Wars Problem Solution.

## Definition and Usage

The `fromCharCode()` method converts Unicode values into characters.

**Note:** This is a static method of the String object, and the syntax is always `String.fromCharCode()`.

```javascript
function getChar(c){
  return String.fromCharCode(c);
}
```
